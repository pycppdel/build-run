Documentation about build & run.

Build & run provides an engine as well as an compiler, which can interpret a
script written in the simple language Plain.

Contents of a .plain file:

--------------------------
|                        | -> Section .config:
|                        |                     Section for configuration data needed for your Project
|                        |
|                        | -> Section .data // optional:
|                        |                    Section for declaring all variables needed
|                        |
|                        | -> Section .code:
|                        |                  Section for the code
|                        |
|                        | -> Section .style:
|                        |                  Section for changing the style/engine of your built game
|                        |                  This Section can only be opened once, if it was to be reopened your program will not compile
|                        |
|                        |
--------------------------

Interaction in between Sections like configuring .config stuff of the game in the .code Section
is not supported, can be achieved however by opening up the needed Section
by typing:

Section .[NAME]
 //stuff
Section end


A Lot of stuff needs to be coordinated inside the game engine, therefore
there are libraries to deal with them.
