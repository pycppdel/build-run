-----In this file the basic I/O functions on the UI will be described------


There are only a few I/O Functions for the UI, since there is a bigger library to include under <Draw>

:NOTE: colors<enum> can also be replaced with a list of ints, representing rgb. e.g.  : int[] green = {0, 255, 0};

Main functions:

UIprint(string data, int x_position, int y_position, colors<enum>/int[] color=BLACK/{R, G, B}, int size=30)         : prints the strings data beginning with x and y position, with color color and size size
DrawPixel(int x_position, in y_position, colors<enum>/int[] color=BLACK/{R, G, B})                                  : sets a pixel on the screen
DrawPixel(Point p, colors<enum>/int[] color=BLACK/{R, G, B})                                                        : sets a pixel on the screen
DrawLine(int x_position, int y_position, int x_position2, int y_position2, colors<enum>/int[] color=BLACK/{R, G, B}): draws a line from x, y to x2, y2
DrawLine(Point p1, Point p2, colors<enum>/int[] color=BLACK/{R, G, B})                                              : draws a line from point one to point two
DrawRect(int x, int y, nt with, int height, )
DrawRect()
DrawCircle()
DrawArc()
UIrefresh()                                                                                        : refreshes the screen and clears it. All operations must be called again to draw on it


Basic I/O Objects:

Point()
Image()
Rect()
Circle()
Arc()
