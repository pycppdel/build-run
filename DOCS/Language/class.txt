Class is subclass of global class Object, therefore has all of the according functions.




Declaring a class:

class NAME (inherits ...){ // optional

init NAME(){

}

deinit NAME(){



}

function NAME2(d, f){

}




}

getting superclass methods can be achieved through calling super.

Super is a reference to the Superclass, which is at least almost Object.

calling superclass init:  super.init()
